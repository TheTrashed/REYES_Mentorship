# Domain Coloring

The *src* directory contians code for the following:
- Defining complex functions.
- Converting complex phase angles to HSV color scheme for plotting
- Converting the HSV color scheme to RGB using the algorithm provided [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV#HSV_to_RGB).
- Writing data to file for gnuplot for 3D plotting (separate 3d plots for real and imaginary components).
- Writing data to file plotting a domain colored plot in gnuplot.

The *figures* directory comprises the **main** functions used for the generation of the plots.
